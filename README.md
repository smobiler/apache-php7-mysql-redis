# Apache PHP7 MySQL Redis
<p>Base Docker image for development environments using Apache, PHP7, MySQL and Redis.</p>
<p>Registered on Docker as <strong>cvsouth/apache-php7-mysql-redis</strong>.</p>
<p>While in theory possible, this image is not intended to be used direct and rather used as a base image for other images to inherit from (abstract). For an environment template which uses this as it's base image see <a href="https://github.com/cvsouth/template-environment">cvsouth/template-environment</a>.</p>
